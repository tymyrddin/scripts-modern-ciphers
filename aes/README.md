# AES: A symmetric block cipher

AES is a symmetric key, block cipher algorithm. It is used in many common Internet protocols and operating system services, including TLS, IPSec, and file-level or full-disk encryption. Given its ubiquity, it is an important cipher to know how to use, and the principles of correct use of AES transfer easily to correct use of other ciphers.

Even though AES is a block cipher, it (like many other block ciphers) can be used in a way that makes it behave like a stream cipher.
