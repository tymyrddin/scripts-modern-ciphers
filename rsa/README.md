# RSA: An asymmetric key exchange

Implementing our own RSA encryption/decryption, rather than using a library, is not a good idea at all. Which is exactly why I am doing it, to replicate the failures of others, and to abuse such vulnerabilities. **Do not under any circumstances use this code for real communication**. It is unsafe and insecure!
